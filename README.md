### About
- Twitterify is a web application which provides quick accurate and valuable statistical insights on real time twitter data.
- The application consists of three modules that focusses on analyzing trending data, threads and user profiles respectively.
- The application aquires real time twitter data from the twitter API's. The data is processed and then analyzed before the insights are shown to the users
- Check out the website landing page for more information: https://ssrtdevs.github.io/Twitterify-landing-page/

### Why Twitterify?
- Twitter is a popular platform where millions of tweets are posted daily to share opinions. To comprehend user opinions or trending hashtags, users have to spend a significant amount of time reading tweets.
- The application aims to provide insightful information based on the sentiments and emotions expressed in trending Twitter data, including threads and hashtags. It can be useful for gaining a better understanding of people's opinions on current events. 

### Demonstration

### Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- React JS, Flask, Daisy UI, Hugging Face ML Models, Tweepy library

### Implementation Details
- The platform uses the BART model for Abstractive Text Summarization and BERT model for Sentiment Analysis from [Hugging Face]("https://huggingface.co/")
- The [Tweepy]("https://www.tweepy.org/") library was used to extract the required tweets using the Twitter API's.
- The application conisted of 2 servers catering to the frontend and backend of the application.
- The frontend server was made using React JS and made use of data processed by the Flask server at the backend.
- The flask server soley interacted with the Twitter API's to extract data and processed it based on the corresponding requests made by the React Server at the frontend.

### Performance and Analysis

<br/>

Twitterify has achieved a perfect score of 100 in the Best Practices category of the Lighthouse report, indicating that the project conforms to recommended web development standards.

### Achievement

- ðŸŽ‰ Secured runner-up position at the Project Expo organized by our college


### Steps to Download and Integrate
- Prerequisite 
  - Nodejs >= 18
  - Python >= 3.0

1. Fork and Clone the repository on your local machine. 
2. The frontend and backend servers of the application run independently and need to be set up before starting them.
- <strong>Setting frontend</strong>

3. To run the react server, simply navigate to the reactfrontend directory and run ```npm install```. Once the installation completes you just need ```npm start```. This would start the react server on port 3000 on the localhost.
4. The application then can be viewed on the browser on localhost:3000 and can be used by the users.
- <strong>Setting Backend</strong>

5. Setting the Backend could be quite a hassle.
6. To set up the flask server, open the terminal in the flaskBackend directory and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This would install all the necessary packages for the flask server.

- Setting the API keys
7. You need to make ```.env``` inside flaskbackend dir and put the API keys in there. Get your API keys [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/terms?plan=free). 

```
api_key=**********
api_key_secret=***************
access_token=**********
access_token_secret=********
consumer_key=********
consumer_secret=**********
bearer_token=********
```
- Setting up models: (This will be time consuming ðŸ˜¢)
8. Head over [here](https://github.com/SSRTDevs/Twitterify/blob/models/README.md) to know about model setup
9. To run the flask server, run ```flask --app server run``` subsequently on the terminal opened for the flask server. This would start the flask server on port 5000 on the localhost.
