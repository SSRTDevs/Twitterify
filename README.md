### About
- Twitterify is a web application which provides quick accurate and valuable statistical insights on real time twitter data.
- The application consists of three modules that focusses on analyzing trending data, threads and user profiles respectively.
- The application aquires real time twitter data from the twitter API's. The data is processed and then analyzed before the insights are shown to the users
- Check out the website landing page for more information: https://ssrtdevs.github.io/Twitterify-landing-page/

### Why Twitterify?

### Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- React JS, Flask, Daisy UI, Hugging Face ML Models, Tweepy library

### Implementation Details
- The platform uses the BART model for Abstractive Text Summarization and BERT model for Sentiment Analysis from [Hugging Face]("https://huggingface.co/")
- The [Tweepy]("https://www.tweepy.org/") library was used to extract the required tweets using the Twitter API's.
- The application conisted of 2 servers catering to the frontend and backend of the application.
- The frontend server was made using React JS and made use of data processed by the Flask server at the backend.
- The flask server soley interacted with the Twitter API's to extract data and processed it based on the corresponding requests made by the React Server at the frontend.


### Steps to Download and Integrate
1. Clone the repository from
2. The frontend and backend servers of the application run independently and need to be set up before starting them.
3. the flaskBackend folder corresponds to the flask server and the reactFrontend corresponds to the frontend server
4. Install the latest versions of Node JS and Python on the device that would be required to set up and run the application
5. To set up the flask server, open the terminal in the flaskFrontend directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt. This would install all the necessary packages for the flask server
6. To set up the flask server, open the terminal in the reactBackend directory and run npm intsall. This would install all the necessary packages for the react server
7. To run the flask server, run export FLASK_APP=sever.py and flask run subsequently on the terminal opened for the flask server. This would start the flask server on port 5000 on the localhost.
8. To run the react server, run npm start on the terminal opened for the react server. This would start the react server on port 3000 on the localhost.
9. The application then can be viewed on the browser on localhost:3000 and can be used by the users.
