  "You can get pretty damn far in life by just saying what you're going to do and then doing it. No fancy hack needed.",
  "Most of us need fewer friends and more intellectual sparring partners. Friends are easy to come by, but intellectual sparring partners question our assumptions and force us to level up.",
